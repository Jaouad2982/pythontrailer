Trailer movie

The page displays a list of my fav movies, using a python database 
we also use javascript,html and css to make it look pretty and well organized.
=================
First thing, make sure you hava python installed in your computer, if needs help check python website, In my case I am using pychar which 
works like a charm, you can push your directory from pycharm using VCS or if you do not have it, try installing git bash and push it manually
=================
To run this project

Open file movies/entertain.py in Python Charm or IDLE shell if you do not have Charm 
Run the module by pressing the run button on pycharm
After you do that, you should be able to see your website opening in a new browser if you chose so
The movies are being rendered the way they are because of HTML and CSS and Javascript.
You can always clone this project and test it your way if you feel like it 
happy to share
